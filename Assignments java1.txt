
                           PART A – THEORY QUESTIONS

Q1. What is Java and why is it platform-independent? 

Ans:-1)It is a programming language developed in 1995 by Sum Microsystem(now own by Oracle) .
2)Java is design and created by James Gosling.
3)It is a pure object oriented and High level programming language.
4)The current stable version of java is java25.
5)Use for developed Applications like web app,mobile app,Desktop app etc. 

PLATFORM  INDEPENDANT:- 
1)Platform means the Operating system.
2)The java program can execute on any Operating system.
3)Java follows the rule:
“Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA).


Q2. Explain the features of Java. 

Ans:-1)Platfrom independant
-Platform means Operating System.The java program can execute on any Operating system.
-Java follows the rule:
"Write Once, Run Anywhere"(WORA).

2)Pure object oriented
-Due to the design the policy of java everything in java is consider as an object.

3)Simple
-Java is easy to learn and use.
-Syntax is similar to C/C++.
-No complex features like pointers.
-Automatic memory management .

4)Secure
-No pointer usage.
-JVM checks bytecode before execution.
-Strong exception handling.

5)Robust
-Due to the feature like Automatic garbage collection,Exception handling,Type checking.

6)Multithreaded
-Java supports multithreading.
-Multiple tasks can run at the same time.
-Improves performance.


Q3) What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM? 

Ans:1)JDK(Java Development Kit)
-It is a software development kit used to build java application
-It contains the JRE and set of developments tools.
-Required by developers to write, compile and debug code.
-Platform dependent.

2)JRE(Java Runtime Environment)
-It provides an environment to run java program but does not include development tools.
-It contains JVM and libraries.
-Does not support compilation and debugging.

3)JVM(Java Virtual Machine)
-JVM is a core excution engine of java.
-It is responsible for convrting bytecode into machine code.


Q4)What is bytecode in Java? 

Ans:-When the source code is compiled by compiler then the .class file is generated that file is called Bytecode .
-That bytecode is given to the JVM and JVM is responsible to execute the .class file.
-Bytecode is platform independent which run on any platform hence java is platform independent.


Q5)Explain the concept of object-oriented programming. 
1)Class:-
-Class is user defined data type.
-A class  contains variables,methoda,constructor,non-static blocks and static blocks.
-A class can not be private but inner class can be private/public /protected.
-Class is not allocate memory when it is defined.
-Class is a logical entity.

2)Object:-
- An object is an  instance of a class .
-An object is allocated memory when it is created.
-An object is a physical entity.
-We can create multiple objects of a class.
-To use the concept of class we have to create the object of that class.

3)Inheritance
-One class aquired the properties of another class.
-Using inheritance we can reuse all methods and data members in next class.
-protected access modifier is used.
-extends keyword is used for provide things from super to subclass.
-Their are 3  types of inheritance in java
1)Single Inheritance  2)Multilevel Inheritance  3)Hierachical Inheritance
-But java does not support Multiple Inheritance ,but we can achieve it by using Interface.

4)Polymorphism:-
-Polymorphism means one method having multiple forms.
-Poly is a greek word mean many and morphic means form.
-Their are two types of Ploymorphism 
-1)overloading :-It happens at compile time also called as static which required same name,same scope and different parameter.
-2)overriding:-It happens at run time also called as dynamic which required same name,same prototype/header/signature and different scope.
-It needs inheritance.

5)Abstraction:-
-We know what but don't know how.
-It is also called as data hiding.
-Using abstract class and interface we can achieve.
-In abstraction we are hide a logic in between methods.
-'abstract' keyword is used.
-Hiding implementation details and showing only what is necessary.
-Interface supports 100% abstraction.

6)Encapsulation:-
-Encapsulation means wrapping data and methods together into a single unit.
-To achieved tight bond Encapsulation the data members have to be made as private.


		PART B – PROGRAMMING QUESTIONS


Q1)Write a program to print "Hello, Java!" 

Ans:-public class Hello{
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Hello,Java!");
	}
}


Q2)Write a program to add two numbers. 

Ans:-import java.util.Scanner;
	public class Addition{
	
		public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int a,b;

		System.out.println("Enter value of a:");
		a=sc.nextInt();

		System.out.println("Enter value of b:");
		b=sc.nextInt();

		System.out.println("Addition is:"+(a+b));
	}
}


Q3)Write a program to check whether a number is even or odd. 

Ans:import java.uti.Scanner;
	public class EvenOdd{
		public static void main(String[] args){

		System.out.println("Enter a Number :");
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int num=sc.nextInt();

		if(num % 2==0){
			System.out.println("Even");
		}
		else{
			System.out.println("Odd");
		}
	}
}


Q4)Write a program to find the largest of three numbers. 

Ans:-import java.util.Scanner;
	public class Max{

		public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter 3 values :");
		int a=sc.naxtInt(); 
		int b=sc.naxtInt(); 
		int c=sc.naxtInt(); 

		b=a>b? a:b;
		b=c>b?c:b;

		System.out.println("Max is :"+b);
	}
}


Q5)Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or Zero.

Ans:-
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Pos{

	public static void main(String[] args){

	Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
	System.out.println("Enter a number :");
	int num=sc.nextInt();

	if(num==0){
		System.out.println("Number is Zero");
	}
	else if(num>0){
		Systen.out.println("Number is Positive");
	}
	else if(num<0){
		System.out.println("Number is Negative");
	}
	else{
		System.out.println("Invalid Number !!");
	}
    }
}
