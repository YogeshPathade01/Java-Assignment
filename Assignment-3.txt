Assignment-3

Part - 1

Que-1)Explain single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance. 
	Single inheritance - a single class inherits from one parent class that is single inheritance.
	Multilevel inheritance - a single class inherits from one parent class that is single inheritance.
	hierarchical inheritance - a single class inherits from one parent class that is single inheritance.

Que-2)What is polymorphism?
       polymorphism means one entity can have many forms. In Java, it allows the same method name to behave differently for different objects. 
       there are two types of polymorphism: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. 
       compile-time polymorphism where method call is resolved at compile time based on reference, and it can be achieved by method overloading.
       runtime polymorphism in which method call is resolved at runtime based on actual object. It can be achieved by method overriding.

Que-3)Difference between compile-time and runtime polymorphism. 
	Compile-time polymorphism -
		-compile-time polymorphism in which method call is resolved at compile time based on reference type and method signature.
		-it is also known as static binding. 
		-it is achieved using method overloading.
		-inheritance is not required in compile-time polymorphism.
		-it provide fast execution because method call is resolved at compile time.

        Runtime polymorphism-
        	-runtime polymorphism in which the method call is resolved at runtime based on the actual object type. 
		-It is also known as dynamic binding. 
		-It is achieved using method overriding.
		-inheritance is required in runtime polymorphism.
		-it is slower than compile-time polymorphism because method call is resolved at runtime.

Que-4)What is method overloading? 
	Method Overloading in which multiple methods with the same name but different parameter list in scope. 
	in method overloading, method call is resolved at compile time based on reference type. 
	it is also called compile-time polymorphism or static binding.

Que-5)What is method overriding? 
	Method overriding in which child class provides implementation of parent class method, using the same method name and same parameter list.
 	in method overriding, the return type must be covariant.
	method cannot be private, static, or final for method overriding.
        in overriding, access modifiers cannot be weakened but they can be widened.
        if a child class method throws a checked exception, the parent class method must throw the same exception. there is no restriction for unchecked exceptions.
        The method call is resolved at runtime based on the actual object type.
	it is also called runtime polymorphism or dynamic binding.


Part - 2


Que-1)Write a program to find the sum of digits of a number. 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SumOfDigitOfNum {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
		int n = scanner.nextInt();
		int sum = 0;

		while (n != 0) {
			int digit = n % 10;
			sum += digit;
			n /= 10;
		}

		System.out.println("Sum of digits: " + sum);
	}

}

Output - 
Enter a number: 123
Sum of digits: 6

Que-2)Write a program to check if a number is prime.
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.lang.Math;

public class IsPrime {
	public static void main(String... args){
		
		int n;
		boolean flag = true;

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		System.out.print("Enter a Number : ");
		n = sc.nextInt();

		if(n == 1){
			System.out.println("Not Prime Number !!");
			System.exit(0);
		}
		
		if(n == 2 || n == 3){
			System.out.println("Not Prime Number !!");
			System.exit(0);
		}

		if(n%2 == 0 || n%3 == 0){
			System.out.println("Not Prime Number !!");
			System.exit(0);
		}else{
			for(int i = 5; i<= Math.sqrt(n); i+=6){
				if(n%i == 0 || n%(i+2) == 0){
					flag = false;
					break;
				}
			}	
			if(flag)
				System.out.println("Prime Number !!");
			else
				System.out.println("Not Prime Number !!");
		}
	}
}

Output -
Enter a Number : 31
Prime Number !! 
 
Que-4)Write a program to print multiplication table of a number.
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MultiplicationTable {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
		int n = scanner.nextInt();
		for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
			System.out.println(n * i);
		}

	}

}

Output - 
Enter a number: 12
12
24
36
48
60
72
84
96
108
120

Que-5)Write a program to count the number of digits in a number. 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CountDigitOfNum {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int count = 0;
		while (n > 0) {
			count++;
			n /= 10;
		}

		System.out.println("The Total Digit of Number : " + count);
	}

}

output - 
Enter a number: 1342
The Total Digit of Number : 4
