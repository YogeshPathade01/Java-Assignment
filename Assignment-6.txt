Assignment-6

Part-A

Que-1)What is the main method’s signature and why is it static?
	public static void main(String[] args)
	main method is enrty point of program, it is static method so jvm called it without creating object by class name.

Que-2)What are wrapper classes in Java?
	wrapper class which convert primitive type to object.
	there are eight types of wrapper class: Integer, Byte, Short, Long, Double, Float, Character, Boolean.
	wrapper class is  immutable  which means once object is created , it cannot be modified.
	wrapper class is final class, means the wrapper class cannot be inherited by another class.
	wrapper class support autoboxing and unboxing.
	wrapper class implement comparable interface.  

Que-3)Difference between equals() and == operator.
	equals() - equal method belong to the Object class. It is used to compare the content of two objects.
		   it returns true if both objects content is same, otherwise false.
		   it can only work with objects, not primitives.
		   equal method defined inside Object class, it compare objects using == operator.
		   to compare object content, it must be overridden in a class.

	== : == is operaotr used to compare reference of object.
	     If both reference point to the same object, then it will return true, otherwise false.
	     it can wokk with primitive and object

Que-4)What is the final keyword used for?
	final means once created, it cannot be modified.
	it is applicable for variable, method, and class.
	if variable declared as a final, then once assigned a value, it cannot be changed. It can work for instance, static, and local variables.
	if a method declared as a final, then it cannot be overridden by subclasses.
	if a class declared as a final, then it cannot be inherited by another class.

Que-5)Difference between final, finally, and finalize.

	final - final means once created, it cannot be modified.
		it is applicable for variable, method, and class.
		if variable declared as a final, then once assigned a value, it cannot be changed. It can work for instance, static, and local variables.
		if a method declared as a final, then it cannot be overridden by subclasses.
		if a class declared as a final, then it cannot be inherited by another class.

	finally - finally is  block of code that is always executed whether the exception occur or not.
		  It is used to perform necessary cleanup tasks such as closing file, releasing resource.
	
	finalize -  finalize is a method of object class, it is called by garbage collector before destroying an object.
		    It is used to cleanup activities such as releasing resource.

Part -B

Que-1)Write a program to find frequency of each character in a String.
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Scanner;

class CountFreOfChar {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		System.out.println("Enter a string: ");
		String str = sc.nextLine();

		HashMap<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();

		for (char ch : str.toCharArray()) {
			if (ch == ' ')
				continue;

			if (freq.containsKey(ch)) {
				freq.put(ch, freq.get(ch) + 1);
			} else {
				freq.put(ch, 1);
			}

		}

		for (char ch : freq.keySet()) {
			System.out.println(ch + ": " + freq.get(ch));
		}

	}
}

Output - 
Enter a string: 
hollo
h: 1
l: 2
o: 2

Que-2)Write a program to remove whitespace from a String.

import java.util.Scanner;

class RemoveWhitespaces {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
		String str = sc.nextLine();
		String result = str.replaceAll("\\s+", "");
		System.out.println("after removing whitespaces: " + result);

	}
}
Output - Enter a string: java is object-orient programming
after removing whitespaces: javaisobject-orientprogramming

Que-3)Write a program to remove duplicates from a String.
import java.util.Scanner;

public class RemoveDuplicateFromString {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		System.out.println("Enter a string: ");
		String str = sc.nextLine();

		String result = "";

		for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
			char ch = str.charAt(i);
			if (result.indexOf(ch) == -1) {
				result += ch;
			}
		}
		System.out.println("after removing duplicates: " + result);

	}

}
Output - 
utput - 
Enter a string:
hello worrld
after removing duplicates: helo wrd

Que-4)Write a program to find the first non-repeated character in a String.
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FirstNonRepChar {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
		String str = sc.nextLine();

		str = str.toLowerCase();

		Map<Character, Integer> freq = new LinkedHashMap<>();

		for (char c : str.toCharArray()) {
			if (c != ' ') {
				freq.put(c, freq.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
			}
		}

		char firstNonRep = '\0';
		for (Map.Entry<Character, Integer> entry : freq.entrySet()) {
			if (entry.getValue() == 1) {
				firstNonRep = entry.getKey();
				break;
			}
		}

		if (firstNonRep != '\0') {
			System.out.println("First non-repeated character: " + firstNonRep);
		} else {
			System.out.println("No non-repeated character found.");
		}

	}
}

output - 
Enter a string: hello World
First non-repeated character: h


Que-5)Write a program to find substring in a String.
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FindSubstring {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
		String str = sc.nextLine();
		
		System.out.print("Enter a substring: ");
		String substr = sc.nextLine();
		
		if(str.contains(substr)) {
			System.out.println("Find !!");
		} else {
			System.out.println("Not Find !!");
		}
	}
}



Output - 
Enter a string: yogesh
Enter a substring: gesh
Find !!
